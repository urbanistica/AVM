        <h2>AVM : Our Software Mentor To Enable Student-Driven Learning.</h2>
        <p>The first pilot runs of our original course were experimental, and some elements of what we put into the classroom had to be put together or improvised out of what we could use for free.</p>
        <p>At the core of the curriculum was a video-driven model, that required that students played multiple videos, and search for the right one for a challenge. You can read more about that.</p>
        <p>As successful as that program was, it pushed the limits of what could be done with off-the-shelf digital tools. We realized that we needed to do better, go farther, and provide a better way to students than these ready-made solutions allowed.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, our team has deep experience in developing bespoke digital tools. And so was born AVM - Apptessesce Video Mentor.</p>
        <p>In mid 2023 we began a development project to bring together the key pedagigical requirements of our courses. This would do several things.</p>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>It would assemble videos into end-on-end, looping playing playlists so students wouldn't have to click multiple links to see all the videos in their challenges.</li>
            <li>It would provide feedback on both correct answers, and nearly-correct answers, and give students as many chances as they needed to find the answer.</li>
            <li>It would act as a learning-reinforcement tool by being able to mix previously-seen videos into new playlists, so students would get reminders of previously learned skills</li>
            <li>It would be able to run independently of the internet, delivering the highest resolution video for the clearest playback without interruption: even when electiricity was also interrupted.</li>
            <li>It should allow remote updates, so that curriculum can be continously improved with minimal or no interruption to classes and schools.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The completed result represents the unique and only learning aid that can drive the skills and knowsdge acquisition at the ambitious level that our courses are characterised by, using our video-driven model. </p>
        <p>AVM is the result, and we provide it as the delivery method for our courses.</p>
