        <h2>Actual Student-Centred Tech Education (For a Change).</h2>
        <p>A good way to understand our approach is to learn about challenges as a component of AVM learning.</p>
        <p>Challenges are at the heart of AVM-based curricula. A challenge is something that a team of six sets out to solve.</p>
        <p>Within the team of six, students operate in pairs, sharing a workstation.</p>
        <p>In a challenge, all students are shown the same playlist via AVM. This is made up of mulitple videos. Each pair searches the playlist for a unique goal, that takes the form of one or more of the videos.</p>
        <p>Each pair completes the first part of their challenge by correctly identifying the video of the skill they must identify.</p>
        <p>Once they have, they test their new skill in the actual target application they are learning to use; and when AVM provides positive feedback that they have found the right answer, the learing section of the current challenge is complete.</p>
        <p>But the challnge isn't yet over.  At this point each successful pair turn into teachers to the other two pairs in their team of six. Generally, this can happen by splitting up to each sit with the other two pairs. But they can also use screensharing technology in Discord to demonstrate to any other students as well.</p>
        <p>By demonstrating what they have learned to the others, and ensuring that each skill is correctly passed on to the others, drives complex interactions, collaborations, discussions and explanations that provide the curriculum its constantly enriching character.</p>
