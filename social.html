        <h2>Social Learning Eliminates Screen-Focused Tunnel-Vision</h2>
        <p>Our focus is on Technology, and how it's learned. Our roots go back to the late 1990's when we developed the very first examples of what are now known as Tech Bootcamps, or Coding Camps. </p>
        <p>Putting 20+ people together in the same room, often for more than 12 hours a day, usually for weeks at a time, and sometimes seven days a week is stressful.</p>
        <p>This quickly revealed several things; but some of the most important were how people organized themselves into groups to promote learning.</p>
        <p>We noticed that students who tried to "go it alone" had the highest achievement, but the highest burnout rates. THey were the most likely to feel isolated, and impatient with the other students. The net result was performance below the mean.</p>
        <p>This made us see all teaching as having a crucial social component; but tech learning more than most. </p>
        <p>Students who succeeded tended to pair up or work in threes on regular learning. On Projects (a major focus for AVM classes), groups of four to six were the most successful.</p>
        <p>We eventually organized all our bootcamps, wherever we ran them – Toronto, Boston, Ecuador, Canary Islands, Bali and Thailand – around multiples of six, with a preference for classes of 12 or 18.</p>

        <h3>How This Shapes AVM</h3>
        <p>As the other pages on Learing Environments and Curriculum go into, we've built AVM on a team size of six, with pairs making up each team. Generally, there are two or three teams in a class, for a normal maximum of 18 students. </p>
        <p>Pairs interact together because they share a workstation; pairs within a team interact, constantly, because they act as peer-instructors for each other during each and every challenge. And when it comes to projects, teams can compete between themselves in a balanced way.</p>
        <p>Neither teams nor pairs are permanent, and either themselves or under the direction of teachers, these are reorganized all the time. So the overall dynamic is to encounter each of the other students in a challenge situation,that tests and reveals – and rewards – each student's adaptablitiy, collaborative readiness, and generally creates a classroom energy that allows elements of play, exploration, inquiry, testing, and competition that contribute to genuine mastery.</p>
