        <h2>Environmental Design That Accelerates Learning.</h2>
        <p>Most classrooms focus on line-of-sight from teacher to students and back. In AVM classrooms, we focus on student-to-student visibility.</p>
        <p>What seems like a small thing; desks in AVM classrooms are arranged in an arc of 3 together. But this is a key part of our challenge-driven curriculum.</p>
        <p>Providing a line of sight for each student every other, within each team of six students, the social learning aspects of AVM are reinforced by these simple arrangents.</p>
        <p>Each desk has one workstation; two students share the desk, and the workstation. You can read more about how this promotes social learning.</p>
        <p>Suprisingly, students generally have their back to the teacher, who are positioned where they can still oversee the classroom</p>
        <p>But because the focus is on students acquiring skills and knowledge by working together, and not by focusing on a kind of authoritative teacher figure, the need for traditional ideas about teacher placement is reduced.</p>
        <p>The underlying message to students is simple: the ability to discover, question and learn lies within you, and your fellow learners.</p>
        <p>Observably in our completed courses, this develops in students a sense of respect, reliance, and a sense of genuine accomplishment and pride in themselves and in their fellow learners.</p>
        <p>On the teaching side, the teaching load is reduced, and the teachers require less training and preparation to effectively guide students through the course.</p>
